# OBJECT DETECTION WITH AQUARIUM DATASET USING YOLOv8LARGE AND YOLOv8XLARGE MODELS

This project focuses on developing and evaluating object detection models using the YOLOv8 architecture to identify and classify various marine species in the Aquarium dataset. The dataset consists of images with seven classes: fish, jellyfish, penguin, puffin, shark, starfish, and stingray. We trained two models, YOLOv8Large and YOLOv8XLarge, and assessed their performance based on precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics. The results demonstrate that both models achieve high accuracy, with YOLOv8XLarge slightly outperforming YOLOv8Large. These models can be effectively utilized for real-time object detection in marine environments, contributing to advancements in marine biology research and conservation efforts.
